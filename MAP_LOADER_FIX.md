# Map Loader Fix V1 - Changelog

## Issue Summary
The Google Maps integration was failing to load properly, resulting in blank map screens. The issue was traced to three primary causes:

1. **Script Loading Failures**: The Google Maps JavaScript SDK was not properly loading or timing out
2. **API Key Issues**: Invalid, expired, or referrer-blocked API keys causing silent failures  
3. **Container Sizing Problems**: Zero-height containers preventing map rendering

## Root Cause Analysis
- `useGoogleMapsLoader` had flawed retry logic that didn't properly reinitialize failed loads
- No timeout detection for hanging script loads (common on slow connections)
- Missing error categorization and user-friendly error messages
- Container height validation was insufficient
- No graceful fallback UI when maps failed completely

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Google Maps Loader (`useGoogleMapsLoader.tsx`)
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging and diagnostics behind `map_loader_fix_v1` flag
- ✅ Implemented 5-second timeout detection for hanging scripts
- ✅ Enhanced error categorization (missing_key, invalid_key, referrer_blocked, timeout)
- ✅ Fixed retry logic to properly reset state and reinitialize
- ✅ Added custom events (`maps:loaded`, `maps:error`) for better debugging
- ✅ Improved existing promise handling to prevent race conditions

### 2. Error UI Components
- ✅ **MapErrorBanner**: Contextual error messages with actionable links to Google Console
- ✅ **StaticErrorState**: Graceful fallback when maps completely fail to load
- ✅ Both components provide clear retry functionality and alternative suggestions

### 3. Container Sizing Guards (`useMapInitialization.tsx`)
- ✅ Added container dimension validation with detailed console warnings
- ✅ Automatic fallback sizing when containers have zero height
- ✅ Enhanced debugging logs for container sizing issues
- ✅ Force resize trigger after initialization to ensure proper rendering

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling (`RealGoogleMap.tsx`)
- ✅ Added `min-h-[300px]` to prevent zero-height containers
- ✅ Integrated new error banner and fallback components
- ✅ Custom event listeners for real-time error detection
- ✅ Progressive error handling (banner → fallback → complete failure)

### 5. Feature Flag Protection
- ✅ All new functionality is behind `map_loader_fix_v1` feature flag
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained when flag is disabled
- ✅ Enhanced logging only appears in development with flag enabled

## Error Types Handled

| Error Type | Detection | User Message | Action |
|------------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| `missing_key` | No API key provided | "Google Maps API Key Required" | Link to Google Console |
| `invalid_key` | API key rejected by Google | "Invalid API Key" | Link to enable Maps API |
| `referrer_blocked` | Domain not in allowed referrers | "API Key Blocked" | Link to update restrictions |
| `timeout` | Script fails to load in 5s | "Map Loading Timeout" | Retry button |
| `unknown` | Other failures | Generic error message | Retry button |

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
- Blank grey screen on map page
- No error feedback to users
- Console showed loading state stuck at `isLoading: false, isLoaded: false`
- No way to diagnose the actual problem

### After Fix
- Clear error messages with specific guidance
- Actionable buttons linking to Google Console
- Comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Graceful fallback UI that still allows venue browsing
- Automatic retry functionality

## Performance Impact
- Minimal: Only adds event listeners and console logs in development
- Error UI components are lazy-loaded only when needed
- Feature flag allows easy rollback if issues arise

## Next Steps
1. Monitor error event analytics to track most common failure modes
2. Consider adding automated API key validation
3. Potentially add offline map tile caching for better reliability
4. Evaluate need for alternative map providers as backup

## Feature Flag Status
- `map_loader_fix_v1`: ✅ **ENABLED** - Ready for production use
- Monitor for 1 week before considering flag removal
